This Repositoy includes my anomaly detection project.
ïƒ˜	Human Activity Recognition in  Videos using LSTM with CNN Features
I implemented anomaly detection in video sequences using a combination of CNN and LSTM models. This project utilized the UCF CRIME dataset, which originally contained 14 classes, but we focused on analyzing 8 specific classes.
